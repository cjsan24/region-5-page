          <h1>Welcome to the General Assembly Region 5 Outcomes Team!</h1>
          <p>General Assembly as an organization has grown and changed throughout the years and our team is further proof of our ever evolving nature. Before the Pandemic General Assembly had in person campuses with dedicated teams of instructors, student succes, and of course Outcomes Coaches. In response to the changes of our world General Assembly went remote and closed several of our campuses. As a result we were consolodated into the North America West Coast Outcomes Team! While many of us were based in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle we were all working and collaborating remotely. After the permanent shift to online and remote work our team members moved about the country and we hired on coaches outside of the West Coast. As we grew our name soon changed into Region 5 of the Outcomes teams in General Assembly. While many of us are still based on the West Coast we are determined to help and support our job seekers, students, and graduates throughout the country!</p>
