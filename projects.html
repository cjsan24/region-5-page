            <h3>Region 5 Hackathons</h3>
            <p>Job seekers and students alike understand the importance of having more projects and experiences under their belts. With this need Region 5 hosts Hackathons every quarter where teams compete with a set theme in a sprint style setting. In groups of roughly 6-8 General Assembly grads coming from the UX, Software Engineering, and sometimes Data fields will work together for 3-5 days in creating websites or applications to not only build experience but to put out a concept that can help solve a real world problem. In the past Region 5 has hosted Hackathons based on Sustainability, Holiday Transport and Delivery, Gamification, AI for Good, and Accessibility. With many more Hackathons on the way stay tuned to what we have coming up!</p>

            <h3>Second Coach Audits</h3>
            <p>While each General Assembly graduate is already paired with a Career Coach, Region 5 believes that the talent on the team can be shared to support all graduates working with the coaches in Region 5. Spearheaded by Sam, coaches open up their availability to meet with other General Assembly grads to give insight, inspiration, validation, and reinforcement of their assigned coach. We believe that General Assembly is a network in itself and we are here to help our graduates succeed!</p>

            <h3>Job Seeker Hygee</h3>
            <p>It's not a secret that hiring tends to slow down during the winter holidays but that doesn't mean Region 5 slows down. To get our job seekers primed for hot hiring season we hosted a Job Seeking Hygee where each coach facilitated events and activities for job seekers to take part in. From shaking off imposter syndrome, maintaining motivation, to mindfulness to stay persistent in the job search all with an emphasis on cozyness!</p>

            <h3>Networking Fest</h3>
            <p>Hosted by Coach Emily, Region 5 participates in routine networking fests where our job seekers and graduates have daily challenges in networking and connecting with alumni, professionals, or industry leaders that can help them learn more about their field of choice, gain powerful referrals, or get a bump towards interviewing that some might need.</p>

            <img class="project-image" src="images/AGS.jpg" alt="Alumni Group Sessions">
            <h3>Alumni Group Sessions</h3>
            <p>Co-Founded by Coach Rachel, Alumni Group Sessions happen weekly with a new coach facilitating in demand topics for our grads to continuing learning and growing towards their goals in landing a job. In the past we've had technical interview prep sessions, recruiter Ask Me Anything Panels, UX portfolio workshops, and even how to use ChatGPT in your job search. These sessions have been going strong with hard work from both the coaches and the GA grads that attend. </p>

            <h3>Employee Resource Group Leadership</h3>
            <p>At General Assembly there are several ERG's or Employee Resource Groups that the GA Staff can be a parrt of. While we have members in many groups such as the Latine, Pride, Disability Impacted, and many more some of our team members at Region 5 have taken a leadership role in some of these resource groups.  </p>

            <h3>Technical Practice Sessions</h3>
            <p>Our General Assembly graduates learn a myriad of skills and have a good chunk of projects under their belt but there is always room for practice for the technical interview. Led by Coach CJ there are weekly technical practice sessions where grads can work together or alone on a Leetcode Problem where we simulate a coding challenge for 45 minutes of work time and then 15 minutes of code share out similar to what would happen in a technical interview. We use this time to help our grads not only practice coding and challenges but also how to verbalize the code that they've worked on. </p>

            <h3>Agile Project Sprint</h3>
            <p>Led by Coaches Sam and Rachel, the Agile Product Development Club was implemented to create cross functional teams of UX Designers and Software Developers to complete projects over the course of 6 weeks using the Agile Methodology. In the teams members will come up with a project idea to solve a client pain point. During the program the GA grads receive mentorship, guest lectures, and support from the Career Coaches facilitating the project. </p>
